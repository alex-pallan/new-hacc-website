Welcome to the Puzzler Submission Page! Here’s how you can create and submit your own Puzzler for other club members to solve. Please follow these steps carefully to ensure your submission is reviewed and posted correctly.

### **1. Title**

- Choose a unique and descriptive title for your Puzzler.
- Make sure it reflects the challenge or theme of your Puzzler.

### **2. Category**

- Select the appropriate category for your Puzzler. Categories include:
  - Cryptography
  - Linux Skills
  - Password Cracking
  - Steganography
  - Other (Please specify)

### **3. Difficulty**

- Choose a difficulty level that accurately represents the challenge of your Puzzler:
  - Easy: Suitable for beginners or as a warm-up.
  - Medium: Requires some experience and understanding of the category.
  - Hard: Challenging, suitable for advanced members.
- We understand that this can be mostly subjective, but do your best to assign the correct difficulty.

### **4. File to Download**

- Include a downloadable file if your Puzzler requires one (e.g., a file to analyze, an encrypted message, or a program to reverse engineer).
- Ensure the file is correctly formatted and free of any unintended content.

### **5. Credit**

- Decide whether you would like to receive credit for creating the Puzzler.
- If you opt for credit, your name or alias will be displayed alongside the Puzzler when it’s posted.
- If you prefer to remain anonymous, select the option to submit without credit.

### **6. Solution (For Cabinet Review Only)**

- Provide a detailed solution to your Puzzler. This is for the cabinet’s eyes only and is for reviewing your submission.
- Your solution should explain the steps needed to solve the Puzzler and highlight any specific knowledge required.
- **The solution must be in the form of a flag in the format `hacc{flag_data_here}`**

### **7. Submit Your Puzzler**

- Once all the fields are completed, submit your Puzzler for review.
- The cabinet will review your submission to ensure it meets our guidelines and doesn’t contain inappropriate material.
- You’ll be notified once your Puzzler is approved and posted on the site.
