This is the file that the website looks at for the list of events.

Each event on the website has three fields, with the following formatting:
# Name of event
## MM/DD/YYYY
### Type
[Link Text](href)

If the event does not contain all of these three fields, it will be ignored.

You can seperate each event with a newline.

Anything that is not in that format will be ignored.

Pro tip: You can include icons with html code. Because our website uses Bootstrap we can use their library.
See https://icons.getbootstrap.com/ and paste the Icon font html into the field
