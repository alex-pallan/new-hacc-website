              ><br /><br />In fall 2016, IASG purchased materials for the Sheep
              City project. The project consists of 3 small wireless routers and
              3 Raspberry Pi 3s acting as wireless clients, as well as an
              additional Pi to act as the “ISP”. The project is a small scale
              model of a city street that may have various wireless networks in
              play.<br /><br /><img
                src="sheep_city.jpg"
                alt="sheep_city.jpg"
                style="width: 25rem; max-width: 100%"
                class="hacc-box"
              /><br /><br />Each wireless network is different. The first
              network requires no authentication and does not use encryption.
              This network is useful for experimenting with passive wireless
              sniffing in monitor mode. The wireless traffic of one of the Pis
              can be intercepted and analyzed. This is effective for
              demonstrating why unsecured wireless networks should not be
              used.<br /><br />The second wireless network is secured with WEP
              (“Wired Equivalent Privacy”). WEP is an obsolete wireless security
              scheme that can be compromised in a matter of minutes. This
              network is useful for learning about attacking WEP networks and
              why they should not be used.<br /><br />The third network is
              secured with WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access), which is the modern
              standard for wireless security in SOHO networks. However, with a
              weak key and a captured handshake, these networks may not be
              perfectly secure either. This network allows for the Pi's 4-way
              handshake to be captured and used to recover the network's
              pre-shared-key (PSK).<br /><br />Sheep City is ultimately a
              work-in-progress, and we hope to add more wireless devices to it
              in the future. This way, once a network is compromised, there are
              other devices to attack. The Raspberry Pis are also capable of
              hosting vulnerable services.
