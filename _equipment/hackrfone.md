  <i class="bi bi-exclamation-triangle"></i> This device is capable of transmitting on frequencies that may be <b>illegal</b> to transmit on. Please be VERY aware of what frequencies and power levels you are allowed to transmit on before starting transmitting. {{ site.clubacronym }} does not condone this device being used for illegal purposes.

VHF/UHF Rx/Tx software defined radio. Everything you need to start playing with your RF protocols. We have a basic 75MHz - 1GHz antenna, but if a special antenna is desired, we will see what we can do about getting it. If borrowed, please always leave an antenna on the device when even close to using it. Receiving, and more so transmitting has the potential to damage the device if no antenna is attached.
