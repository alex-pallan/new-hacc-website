# THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE PROJECT

I am working on re-making the HACC website for better styling, UI/UX, as well as maintinance with the addition of JSON files containing much of the information on the site

## To-do:
 - Finish making the Meetings page and prepare it for accepting the JSON data
 - Add the favicon once HACC has paid the artist for our new logo
 - Add the logo to the footer once HACC has paid the artist for our new logo
 - Create a JSON file for projects, and add data. Also write code to add projects dynamically to the projects page
 - More that I'm not thinking of at this moment...
