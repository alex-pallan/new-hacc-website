# New ISU HACC Website
## Problem Statement/Solution
The current ISU HACC *(Formerly IASG)* website has outdating styling and information. Redesigning the site has several immediate benefits:
- Easy access to information for prospective members
- Demonstration of legitamacy both for prospective members as well as potential sponsors of the club
- Sense of pride for being in an important and innovative club
- Demonstration that we are an active and busy club, both inside and outside of our Discord

## Framework
This new site is built on two primary frameworks for ease of maintenance and modification. 
1. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/): a static site generator directly supported by **GitHub**
2. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): a frontend toolkit originally designed by a Twitter developer, which has since become among the most popular open-source front-end framworks in the world
It is beneficial for any members to learn these two tools, as they are quite powerful and potentially useful in their careers moving forward.

## Housekeeping
This project is still work-in-progress and the first finished varient is expected to be pushed into production at [https://isu-hacc.github.io/](https://isu-hacc.github.io/) early in the **Fall 2024** semester. For now, you can view the progress at [https://alex-pallan.github.io/new-hacc-website/](https://alex-pallan.github.io/new-hacc-website/).

There are also plans for the website to be moved to a different domain in the future.
